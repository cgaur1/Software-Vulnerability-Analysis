# Software-Vulnerability-Analysis
Competent execution of security assessments on modern software systems requires extensive knowledge in the reverse engineering and vulnerability analysis technical domains.  This course examines software vulnerability analysis relevant theory and its application within security assessments in detail.  Key topics include historical vulnerabilities, their corresponding exploits, and any associated preventative measures.  Fundamental tools and techniques for performing software reverse engineering and vulnerability analysis are covered extensively.  The format of this course includes lectures and hands-on assignments.  Students will complete and demonstrate a project as part of the course.

Following the completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Outline the vulnerability states (e.g., prevention, creation, discovery, exploitation, disclosure, elimination, obsolescence) in the context of the software security lifecycle and identify when vulnerability analysis occurs.
2. Locate vulnerabilities in software artifacts (source code and binary forms), explain the implementation details of their exploits, and describe corresponding preventative measures.
3. Formulate an approach to performing software security assessments and demonstrate core techniques (e.g., static and dynamic analysis or functional testing of security boundaries).
4. Describe the use of relevant security modeling or analysis techniques and explain their role in software vulnerability analysis.
