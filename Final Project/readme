Final Project

Topic: Return Oriented Programming Exploit on NTP Daemon in MAC OS based on CVE-2014-9295

The Network Time Protocol daemon (NTPD) is a program run by the operating system that maintains its system time by synchronizing with the   time server using the Network Time Protocol. In OS X Mavericks, a buffer overflow was discovered with the code of NTPD which handles the   control packets. If these control mode responses exceed the size of the buffer, they are fragmented. This vulnerability is listed as   CVE-2014-9295 discovered by Stephen RÃ¶ttger and has been patched by Apple. In this project, we aim to use this vulnerability and exploit   it with Return Oriented Programming(ROP) to escape the sandbox and obtain shell access.
